<h2><a name="CHRISTMAS-TIME" id="CHRISTMAS-TIME">CHRISTMAS-TIME.</a></h2>


<p>'<span class="smcap">So</span> many men so many minds' has been a proverb
long before our days, and will be to the end
of time and human history; and uniformity of
sentiment is the one thing which men need never
hope to attain.</p>

<p>Christmas-time is one of these battle-fields of
feeling. To some it is just the consecration of
so many circumstances of torture; to others the
meeting-point of so many facts of pleasure. From
the conventional greeting to the orthodox dinner&mdash;from
the 'seasonable gifts' that are more obligatory
than voluntary, to the toast that heralds the
punch, and the dreams that follow on that last
glass&mdash;all is so much pain to the flesh and weariness
to the spirit; and they wonder how any one
can find it otherwise. What is there in Christmas-time
to make it pleasurable? they say. The
gathering together of the family? A lot of rough
boys home from school, who spoil the furniture
and tease the dogs, lame the horses and ravage
the garden, make the servants cross, the girls
rude, and the younger children insubordinate; who
upset all the order of the house, destroy its comfort
like its quiet, and to whose safe return to
discipline and your own restoration to tranquillity
you look forward with impatient longing
from the first hour of their arrival to the last
of their stay? Or the advent of your married
daughter with her two spoilt babies, who cry if
they are looked at and want everything that they
see, and that very objectionable young man her
husband, with his ultra opinions and passion for
argument, whom she would marry in spite of all
that you could say, but to whom you can scarcely
force yourself to be decently civil, not to speak of
cordial, and whose presence is a perpetual blister
while it lasts? Is this the family gathering about
which you are expected to gush?&mdash;this with the
addition of your son's fine-lady wife who snubs his
mother and sisters with as little breeding as
reserve, finds nothing at your table that she can
eat, lives with her smelling-bottle to her nose and
propped up with cushions on the sofa, and gives
you to understand that she considers herself
humiliated by her association with your family,
and your son as much exalted as she is degraded?
This is the domestic aspect of Christmas-time
which is to make you forget all the ordinary
troubles of life, creating in their stead a Utopia
where ill-feeling is as little known as <i>ennui</i>, and
family jars are as impossible as personal discomfort
and dissent. Holding this picture in your
hand, you decline to subscribe your name to the
Io pæan universally chanted in praise of Christmas,
and wrap yourself up in sullen silence when
your neighbour congratulates you on having all
your family about you, and wishes you a merry
Christmas as if he meant it.</p>

<p>If the domestic aspect is disagreeable, what is
the social?&mdash;A round of dinners of which the
<i>menu</i> is precisely the same from Alpha to Omega:&mdash;turbot
and thick lobster-sauce; roast-beef and
boiled turkey; indigestible plum-pudding and
murderous mince-pies; with sour oranges and
sweet sherry to keep the balance even, and by the
creation of two acids perhaps neutralise each
other and the third. This is the food set before
unoffending citizens under the name and style
of Christmas dinners for the month or six weeks
during which the idiotic custom of Christmas dinners
at all is supposed to last. You are expected
to live in this monotony of dyspepsia and antipathetic
diet till you loathe the very sight of the
familiar food, and long for a change with a
vehemence which makes you ashamed of yourself,
and more than half afraid that you are developing
into a gourmand of the worst kind.</p>

<p>As if your nights were not sufficiently broken by
the horrible compounds which trouble your digestion
and disturb your brain, torturers known as
the 'waits' prowl through the streets from midnight
to dawn, causing you agonies beyond those which
even the hurdy-gurdy men inflict. You are just
falling to sleep&mdash;painfully courted and hardly won&mdash;when
a hideous discord worse than the wailings
of cats startles you into a nervous wakefulness
which banishes all hope for that night. What can
you do? They are too far off for that jug of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_802" id="Page_802">{802}</a></span>
water to take effect, and you must not fire;
anathemas do not hurt them, and if said aloud
only waken up your wife and make her cry if
she does not preach. You have nothing for it
then but to lie still and groan inwardly, devoting
to the infernal gods all the idiotic circumstances
by which your life is rendered wretched, and
your health, already frail, set still further wrong.
In the morning, when wearied and nervously
feverish from want of sleep, you go into the
garden for a little quiet and delectation, you find
your greenhouses stripped of the flowers which you
had been lovingly watching for weeks, and your
evergreens as ridiculously cropped as a shaved
poodle. This is the day for the decoration of the
church, and you, having made an expensive hobby
of your garden, have to contribute what has cost
months and good money to rear, for the childish
satisfaction of John and Joan, lasting just two
hours and five minutes. Not only have you lost
your flowers and your evergreens&mdash;that splendid
holly, which yesterday glowed like a flame, today
nothing but a bundle of chopped ends!&mdash;but
you know that your favourite daughter is flirting
with the curate, and that a great deal is going on
under cover of wreaths and crosses, laurustinus and
chrysanthemum, of which you strongly disapprove
yet cannot check. It is Christmas-time; decorating
the church has become in these later days a kind
of religious duty; and as a conscript father of
your village, you must not forbid your daughter
this pious pleasure any more than you can refuse
your costly contribution in kind.</p>

<p>Turn to the financial side of the time; and
what have you?&mdash;bills coming in that you neither
expected nor knew of, and every one looking for a
Christmas-box, and insolent or irritated if they
do not get it. The servants obsequious to the
worth of half a sovereign&mdash;tradesmen and their
lads punctual in anticipation of half-crowns&mdash;postmen
levying blackmail, and watermen and
dustmen demanding as their right that they should
be fee'd for their persistent neglect of duty&mdash;every
one making a dead set at your pocket and trying
to get your money for themselves&mdash;the very
children more caressing and affectionate because it
is Christmas and papa always gives them something
on Christmas-day:&mdash;You groan as you ask
yourself where is disinterestedness on this earth?&mdash;and
you groan still more as you draw your cheques
and reduce your balance and wonder by what law
of right it is that you should be the pipe by which
other folks are to be supplied.</p>

<p>No; you see no good or pleasure in this boasted
Christmas-time as we keep it up in our benighted
country. Its mirth is a sham and its inflictions
are only too real. A time of tumult and expense,
of indigestion and discomfort, you wait, grimly or
fretfully as your mood may be, till it has passed
and the current of your life is allowed to flow
evenly as before. When you hear people sing its
praises you long to stop their mouths, as you
longed to silence the waits who woke you up out
of your first sleep and spoilt your rest for the
night. What manner of men are these, you think,
who can find cause of congratulation in so much
absurdity, if the fun is real to them&mdash;so much
dreary make-believe, if it is unreal? You despise
your genial, laughing, merry-hearted neighbour
who goes into everything <i>con amore</i>, and accepts it
all, from forfeits and snapdragon to plum-pudding
and Christmas-boxes, as if he really liked it. You
think what a fool he must be to be pleased with a
rattle, tickled with a straw like this. But for the
most part you do not believe in his mirth; and
then you despise him still more as a hypocrite as
well. For a hypocrite shamming folly is an
offender against reason as well as truth, whom you
find it hard to forgive, let the motive of his mummery
be what it may.</p>

<p>This is one side of the question; your neighbour
takes the other.</p>

<p>Who on earth, he says with his hands in his
pockets, his back to the fire and his kindly smiling
face to the room, who on earth can grumble at the
facts of Christmas-time? For his part he finds
it the jolliest season of the year, and he finds each
season as jolly as the other, and all perfect in their
own appointed way. He is none of your crying
philosophers who go through life bewailing its
miseries and oppressed by its misfortunes. Not
he! He thinks the earth beautiful, men and
women pleasant, and God very good; and of
all occasions wherein he can transact his cheerful
philosophy, Christmas is the best. The
boys are home for their holidays; and it is
a pleasure to him to take them out hunting
and shooting, and initiate them into the personal
circumstances belonging to English country
gentlemen. He looks forward to the time when
they will take his place and carry on the
traditions of the family, and he wishes them to
be worthy of their name and an honour to their
country. He is not one of those nervous self-centred
men who live by rule and measure and
cannot have a line of the day's ordering disturbed.
He likes his own way certainly; and he
has it; but he can press his elbows to his sides
on occasions, and give room for others to expand.
He does not find it such an unbearable infliction
that his boys should come home and racket about
the place, even though they are a little upsetting,
and do not leave everything quite as smooth and
straight as they found it. He remembers his own
youth and how happy it made him to come home
and racket; and he supposes that his lads are very
much the same as he was at their age. He thinks
too that they do the girls good&mdash;wake them up a
little&mdash;and while not making them rough or rude&mdash;the
mother takes care of that&mdash;yet that they prevent
them from becoming prim and missy, as
girls are apt to be who have no brothers and are
left too much to themselves. Certainly he does
not approve of the flood of slang which is let loose
in the house during their stay; but school-boy
slang at the worst is not permanent, and in a
week's time will be forgotten.</p>

<p>As for the married daughter's children, they are
the merriest little rogues in the world; and his
wife looks ten years younger since they came. She
was always fond of babies; and her grandchildren
seem to renew her own past nursery with all the
pleasure and none of the anxiety of the olden time.
He rather wonders at his girl's taste in the matter
of her husband&mdash;most fathers do&mdash;and cannot for
the life of him see what there is to love in him.
But if not an Alcibiades he is a good fellow in the
main, and makes his young wife happy; which is
the principal thing. And if his daughter-in-law is
a trifle stiff, and fond of giving herself fine-lady
airs, he for his part never stands that kind of
nonsense, and will laugh her out of it before she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_803" id="Page_803">{803}</a></span>
has been twenty-four hours in the house. He
finds good-humour and taking no offence the best
weapons in the world against folly and ill-temper;
and prefers them as curative agents to any other.
The girl is a nice girl enough, but she has been
badly brought up&mdash;had a lot of false ideas instilled
into her by a foolish mother&mdash;but when she has
been away from the old influences, and associated
with themselves for a little while, she will open
her eyes and see things in their right light. Who
indeed could resist the sweet sensible influence of
his wife, her mother-in-law?&mdash;and are not his girls
the very perfection of honest wholesome English
ladies? It will all come right in time; he has no
doubt of that; and meanwhile they must be patient
and forbearing for Dick's sake, and not make
matters worse than they are by their own want of
self-control.</p>

<p>Then as to the Christmas-boxes and the tips
sacred to the season&mdash;well! well! after all they
do not amount to much in the year, and see what
pleasure they give! A man must be but a poor-spirited
surly kind of hound who does not like to
see his fellow-creatures happy; and a very little
kindness goes a great way in that direction. He
takes care to live within his income, and therefore
he has always a margin to go on; and he does not
object to use it. The servants have been very good
on the whole, and do their duty fairly enough.
And when they fail&mdash;as they do at times&mdash;why, to
fail is human, and are they alone of all mankind
to be blameless and never swerving in the right
way? And are they alone of all mankind to be
judged of by their worst and not by their best?&mdash;to
be blamed for failure, but not praised for
well-doing? He does not think so; and not
thinking this, his half-sovereigns are given freely
without the grudging which makes them an
ungracious tax instead of a kindly voluntary gift.
The tradespeople, too, do fairly well, and&mdash;they
must have their profit like any one else! Those
Christmas-boxes to their lads may be the nest-eggs
for future savings; and even if they do go
in a little finery or personal pleasure instead&mdash;young
people will be young, and his own boys
are fond of being smart and amused: so why not
these others? You grumble at the waits? If you
in your warm bed, well fed, well clothed, prosperous
altogether, fret at the loss of an hour's sleep,
what must these poor fellows feel, out in the cold
frosty night, with the wind blowing and the sleet
falling fast, and they not half fed nor a quarter
clothed? For his own part he would like to give
them a glass of hot grog all round; and as for
grumbling at the few coppers which they brave
all this physical discomfort to earn, he makes it
shillings, and hopes it will do them good. We
must live and let live, he says with his broad
smile; and if we are sometimes a little inconvenienced
by the efforts made by the poor to
accomplish the art of living for their own parts&mdash;we
must remember that our loss is their gain, and
that they are men and women like ourselves&mdash;fathers
of families who want to keep the pot boiling
and the fire alight&mdash;mothers who love their
children, and are anxious to do the best for them
that nature and man will allow.</p>

<p>You complain of indigestion and grumble at
the monotony of your Christmas fare?&mdash;That is
strange! Who can grumble at good plain succulent
meat?&mdash;and why do you eat the sweets if they
disagree with you? Neither pudding nor mince-pie
comes into the eternal necessities of things,
and you would do very well if only you would
refrain. He does not eat things that he cannot
digest, and in consequence he sleeps well, and when
he wakes has neither regret nor remorse. Surely
that is not such a painful trial&mdash;to forbear eating
what is hurtful to your health, and in touching
your health corroding your happiness as well.</p>

<p>In a word, the whole difference of the spirit in
which we meet the facts of Christmas depends
on the good or ill humour with which we are
naturally endowed, and which we have cultivated
by common-sense on the one hand, or suffered to
ride rough-shod over our reason on the other. If
we are unselfish and sympathetic, Christmas-time
is as pleasant to us as popular tradition would
make it; if we are egotistical and peevish, it
is a wearisome infliction and a sham which no
honest man can pretend to believe in, nor any
sensible one to admire.</p>

<p>For our own part we believe in Christmas,
because we believe in the kindness of man to man,
in genial good-humour, in unselfishness, and the
liking of wholesome natures to give happiness;
and so far as we have gone yet we have seen no
reason to change our views. A merry Christmas
then to you all, friends, readers, and countrymen;
and a happy New Year to follow after; and may
God bless the rich and care for the poor, and lead
us all in the right way while the day lasts and
before the night has come!</p>

<p class='ph3'>THE STORY OF A DETECTIVE OFFICER.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Long</span> after it had grown quite dark, all remained
quiet, and at last I resolved upon making a move.
I had determined upon fetching Peter Tilley. I
had plenty of assistance, but I thought I should
like to have Peter with me. So I went down to
the ferry; a gas-light which burned at the corner
shewed me before I left my post that the bony
ferryman was not there; and choosing a pretty
good boat, with a strong young fellow to pull, I got
in. It was a most unpleasant night; as dark as
pitch, which was bad enough, but every now and
then it lightened, which was worse, as it dazzled
my eyes, and made me think we were running
smash on board some great vessel which I had not
seen a moment before, and couldn't see a moment
after. However, the boatman was used to all
kinds of weather, I suppose, and knew the river
thoroughly; so through the darkness and the rain,
which never left off for a moment, we reached the
other side.</p>

<p>I left the boat to wait for me, and ran up to the
<i>Yarmouth Smack</i>. I looked in, and saw Peter
leaning against the bar and smoking a short pipe,
as a labourer ought to do; and he was talking in
a friendly way to some rough-looking fellows. I
slipped in, and using the name we had agreed
upon, spoke to him. He knew my voice of course;
but seeing me so changed, for my make-up was
really splendid (it was, although I say so that
shouldn't), it gave him such a shock that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_804" id="Page_804">{804}</a></span>
obliged to put the pewter down he was going to
drink from and look steadily at me before he
answered. 'I'm acoming,' he said at last, and we
got outside; when, as we walked down to the ferry,
I gave him a sort of idea of what was going on, and
how I expected to make a great catch that night.
Peter of course was very glad to be in for such a
big thing as this, for he had never been mixed up
with anything so important.</p>

<p>Not to trust the boatman too much, I kept Peter
back a few yards from the water while I finished
my story, standing a little on one side, so as to be
out of the way of the people who came and went
to and from the ferry. While I was talking to
him, a wherry ran in; we heard her grate on the
pebbles and the sculls rattle as the man laid 'em
in; but that we had heard before. It's a part of my
habit to notice little things however, and I looked
to see who had come in by this boat. There was
only one passenger, a woman, and she passed us
walking quickly; but quick as she walked, I saw
her, and she saw me. Blessed if it wasn't Miss
Doyle! My being there was no odds to Miss Doyle,
nor could it have signified to her if she had seen
me fifty times; yet I felt I would rather not have
met her just then; it looked unlucky, and she was
such an uncommonly sharp one too. Sharp or not,
I couldn't see what she could make out of my
standing under a wall on a wet night talking to
another labourer.</p>

<p>Having finished my explanation, we both got
into the wherry, and I asked the man if he would
like a good long job, which might perhaps last
all night.</p>

<p>'The longer the better, governor,' he says, 'if
the pay is accordin'.'</p>

<p>'The pay <i>will</i> be accordin',' I answered; 'and so
you are engaged.'</p>

<p>The first thing I made him do was to row
round that oyster-smack, for the tide had risen
enough to take us round her. I shewed no light,
but we went inside her twice; and the fellow on
the watch was very sharp, so he was leaning over
the side when we came round the second time, and
I could say quite quiet-like: 'I am in this boat
now&mdash;watch the river.' That was quite enough;
he knew he would not now have to look to the
<i>Anchor</i> for signals.</p>

<p>After this began what I believe was the most
disagreeable sort of patrol I ever had. There was
a time when I used to envy the Thames police;
but I can't say I ever did after that night. We
were obliged to be in motion almost continually,
because we did not know from which side of the
river the paper might come, and we weren't quite
sure that it would come at all, especially on that
night; and I don't know, speaking from my own
experience, that there is anything more trying to
the spirits than the pulling backwards and forwards
and loitering about on the river Thames
in a raw October night with a small thick rain
falling. Twice we landed, and went once to the
<i>Smack</i> and once to the <i>Anchor</i>. I couldn't grudge
the men a glass of hot grog; in fact I was obliged
to have some myself, even if I missed my capture
through it.</p>

<p>It grew later and later; the flashes of lightning
still came at long intervals; but the lights on the
shore went out, and excepting the gas-lamps which
burnt at street-corners, ferries, and wharfs, all
was dark. The traffic on the river had long
ceased, no shouts or rattle of wheels came from the
shore; and the rain still falling, it was, I give you
my word, most horribly miserable, dull and sloppy
beyond description. Twelve o'clock had struck,
and one, and perhaps half an hour beyond it. I
had cautioned my companions to speak very low;
so the boatman only whispered when he said:
'It's as quiet as it is likely to be, governor, if
you've got anything to run. I have just seen the
police galley creep along on the other side; I see
her under that lamp. Now's your time.'</p>

<p>He thought we were smugglers! Perhaps he
didn't care if we were thieves. I told him to be
patient; when at that very instant, just as we were
creeping along under the lee of a coal-barge, a
wherry shot very silently by, right in front of us,
going across stream, and not six feet from our
bows. In her sat the sulky ferryman; I knew
him at a glance, dark as it was. 'Pull after that
wherry,' I said.</p>

<p>'Peter Tilley, my lad,' I continued, turning to
Peter, 'the time's acoming, I think.'</p>

<p>'I'm precious glad of it,' says Peter; 'for I'm
catching a cold in my head every minute I sit in
this confounded boat; and it's all soaking wet
where I'm sitting.'</p>

<p>Our man pulled on; he was a very strong fellow,
as I have said, and we could have overtaken the
other boat directly; but this of course I did not
want. I knew where to look for the old scamp;
and sure enough, after a few strokes across stream,
he bent to the left and ran under the bows of the
Dutch trader.</p>

<p>All was dark and silent as the grave aboard the
ship; but that didn't deceive the old boatman,
nor did it deceive me. I stopped our man in the
shade of the next vessel, if you can call anywhere
a shade, when it was all pitch dark. We had not
been there a minute before I heard a slight noise&mdash;it
was impossible to see any one unless he stood
between you and the sky&mdash;and then I could tell by
the sound that a man had dropped into the wherry.
There was no need to tell me what man it was.
With an almost noiseless dip, the ferryman dropped
his sculls into the river again and rowed on, we
still after him. I took it for granted he was going
to the other side of the ferry; but he suddenly bore
off to the right, and rowed on for some little time,
then striking in between two vessels, he went
straight for the land.</p>

<p>'Where is he going to?' I whispered.</p>

<p>'To the landing at Byrle's wharf,' says the boatman
in the same tone.</p>

<p>So he was; and it appeared this landing-place
was at the farther side of the wharf; that is, lower
down the river.</p>

<p>It was so dark we could hardly see them&mdash;for
we could just make out there were now two
persons in the boat&mdash;but as they reached the shore,
a lamp that was burning on the wharf helped us a
little. We could not clearly see what they were
doing; but they certainly got out of the boat, and
as certainly there were then more than two figures
moving about, and seemingly engaged in placing
parcels in the wherry. But it was very gloomy
there; they were in the shade of the wharf, and
the lamp glimmered weak and faint through the
thick rain. It was the more difficult to see what
was being done, because there were several boats
tied up to the landing-place, making some confusion
in the darkness. At last, however, we could see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_805" id="Page_805">{805}</a></span>
they were pushing off from the shore; so it was
time for us to move. We pulled back for a while
(there was no doubt as to which way the others
would come), and then sheering off, lay between
two colliers until we saw the wherry we had
watched go by, and then we once more pulled
after them.</p>

<p>'I'm blest if I don't think there's another boat
following <i>us</i>,' says Peter Tilley, staring as hard as
he could behind us. I looked, but couldn't see
anything; and Peter owned he might have been
mistaken.</p>

<p>We could not make out how many there were
in the foremost boat. There was only one man rowing,
that was plain; and he pulled short round at
the proper place, as I knew he would, and rowed
towards the Dutch trader. As he did so, we lost
him for a second, a big steamer lying between us;
but the hull of this vessel did not obstruct the
view up the river. I seized the moment, and
waved my lantern twice. It was all right. As
quick as thought the light on board the oyster-smack
was moved twice also, and then we too
were pulling across the stream. I wanted to
capture my men on board the trader, as otherwise
the paper might be got rid of, because I
couldn't be positively certain that it was not
already on board. In fact, Mr Edmund Byrle
was my chief aim, not the skipper.</p>

<p>The wherry pulled under the bows of the vessel;
we followed just in time to see, by a very convenient
flash of lightning, two packages handed
up; then a figure, which we had recognised by the
same flash as the bony ferryman, got into the ship.
As he disappeared, our wherry touched the vessel;
and at the same instant, to my great relief, a long
black Thames police galley came alongside us, and
its crew, five constables, with Barney Wilkins, who
was there as guide, clambered up like cats. I and
Peter imitated them, but not quite so quickly; and
when I looked over the bulwark, I saw by the
light of a couple of lanterns, screened from the
outside, four or five men, the boatman and the
skipper being two, lifting up a great lid which
fitted in the deck&mdash;the hatches I heard it called&mdash;while
by their side lay the packages of paper.
I could not see Mr Byrle; but there was no time to
consider; we all jumped in at once, the men looking
round in amazement at the noise. I fancied
that just then I heard a shout from the boat.</p>

<p>'What do you all want here?' said the skipper
angrily.</p>

<p>'We hold a warrant'&mdash;I began.</p>

<p>'Oh, it is <i>you</i>, is it?' he screeched, like a
hyena, or something of that sort. 'I owe you a
little for a past score, and you shall have it.' As
quick as lightning he pulled a long straight
knife from the side of his trousers, where it must
have been in some sort of sheath, and jumped at
me with such suddenness that he would have
stabbed me, only Barney Wilkins snatched a
handspike from the deck, and dashing between us,
hit him down with such a blow, that the skipper
fell with a crash like a bullock when it is killed,
the blood pouring from his head instantly.</p>

<p>It was all as quick as thought. The other men
were all seized in a breath. So quick was it all
done, that I had no idea Barney was hurt, until
he reeled, made a wild clutch as if he caught at
something for support, and then pitched forward
on his hands and knees.</p>

<p>'Hollo, Barney!' I said, stooping down to him.
'What's the matter, old fellow?'</p>

<p>'It's all up, Mr Nickham,' he gasped; 'he's
done me. I only hope I've killed him. Where's
the other?'</p>

<p>'Oh, never mind the other, Barney,' I says.
'Where are you hurt?'</p>

<p>But as I spoke, one of the men came with a
lantern, and Barney had no occasion to answer
me, for I could see a straight stream of blood
running from his chest on to the deck; and
his hands giving way from weakness, he fell over
on his side.</p>

<p>'Pull in for the shore, you, sir!' said the sergeant
of the Thames police to my waterman. 'You
know Marigold Street? Knock up Mr Gartley, and
tell him what has happened. Say we are afraid
to move the man to his house, so he had better
come aboard.'</p>

<p>'Send one of your own men, will you?' answers
the boatman. 'I've got something to tell the
governor' (that was me), 'as I think he ought
to know.'</p>

<p>'Cut away then, Bill,' says the sergeant to a
constable; 'these fellows are ironed, and we can
manage all that are aboard this craft.'</p>

<p>So the man went off in my wherry; and the
Thames men tried to make poor Barney a little
more comfortable, while I undid his waistcoat,
hoping to stop the bleeding.</p>

<p>'It ain't no use,' he said; but in that short
time his voice was almost gone, and we could tell
that he was dying. 'I'm done for, Mr Nickham.
If there's a reward, you'll act fair and square, I
know; you always was a gentleman&mdash;let my sister
have'&mdash;&mdash; And with that he gave a gasp, and
was dead.</p>

<p>I rose up, dreadfully vexed for the poor chap.
The sergeant and one of his men were looking
after the skipper, when I felt myself touched on
the arm.</p>

<p>'I say, sir,' said the boatman, 'when I'm in for
a thing, I go through with it honourable. Did
you know as you was followed?'</p>

<p>'Followed? no!' I said.</p>

<p>'I thought we was!' said Peter Tilley.</p>

<p>'We was followed, sir, by a light wherry with two
people in it,' continues the boatman; 'and when
they see our boats, they held hard; and as you all
boarded the ship and the noise began, they rowed
away as hard as they could go.'</p>

<p>'Which way did they go?' I said.</p>

<p>'Down river,' says the man. 'But it's of no use
thinking of looking after them now. They are
ashore long afore this.'</p>

<p>This was likely enough; and it was quite certain
that Mr Edmund Byrle was one of the two in the
boat, and I had lost him for the present. Well,
it couldn't be helped; so we set to work to question
the men and search the ship, till the doctor came.
The men knew nothing more about the business
than that they were going to have two passengers,
a lady and a gentleman, this voyage. One of the
Thames men understood Dutch, or we should not
have heard even this scrap of information. The
sulky boatman never uttered a word, except that
once he said as I passed him, and he said it with a
bitter curse: 'I always had my doubts of <i>you</i>.'</p>

<p>The doctor came off; but poor Barney was stone-dead,
while the skipper's skull was badly fractured.
However, the paper was all there; so I supposed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_806" id="Page_806">{806}</a></span>
and so it proved; and I shouldn't have cared if the
skipper's head had been broken fifty times over.</p>

<p>We got our prisoners to the shore, leaving the
craft in charge of a Thames police galley that
came in answer to our signals; and late as it was,
I drove with Peter Tilley in a cab to the City.
Our people there were immensely glad, I can tell
you; and when I went over to the Bank (for there
was no need for secrecy or dodging now), I thought
the gentlemen never would have left off paying
me compliments. Poor Barney Wilkins that was
dead deserved most credit; but it could not do
him any good to say so now, so I let them go on.
The paper was examined, and found to be exactly
the quantity required; enough, I believe, to have
made about twenty thousand bank-notes. Ah! if
they <i>had</i> got into circulation!</p>

<p>I hope you will understand, however, that I
did act fair and square; and when the reward
was paid (and the Bank people did come down
most liberal; I bought my house at Pentonville
with my share), I told the gentlemen about
poor Barney and his wishes; and I'm proud
to say they found his sister out and took her
away; and after a time she went abroad with
kind people who looked after her, and took care
of her money till she got married, and did well.
Why, she sent me a snuff-box made out of pure
Australian gold, with a letter signed by herself
and her husband, who was a butcher in a great
way of business out there; and they sent it as an
acknowledgment of my having acted all fair and
square. I promised so to do, and I did.</p>

<p>Edmund Byrle was never caught, and so far as
we were concerned, was never heard of; and if
it hadn't been for his father, I should never have
understood a lot of things that puzzled me. I had
given a pretty good guess as to how Miss Doyle
came in the first place to inquire about Mr Byrle
and the detective; a very clever idea in itself,
but like many other clever things, it lost her the
game. Mr Byrle had talked with his friends about
employing detectives; and Miss Doyle knowing
about the Bank paper, and being always on the
watch, had got hold of just enough to mislead
her. She went out with Edmund Byrle to Turkey,
I think, and was married to him; and old Mr
Byrle sent out a friend to see them; and it was
in this way I got the particulars. It appears she
knew me again&mdash;only as the limping labourer, of
course&mdash;when she saw me talking at the ferry to
Tilley. But she knew <i>him</i> as the detective at
the <i>Yarmouth Smack</i>, and she thought that although
it might be all right, yet a detective was a dangerous
customer, and his acquaintances might be
dangerous also. Consequently she tried to persuade
Edmund to put off his journey; but he wanted
the money for the paper, and wouldn't listen to
her. But he agreed at last to go aboard in another
boat, which satisfied her, as she felt so certain
the skipper's boat would be attacked. As I have
explained, her precaution saved him from fifteen
years' 'penal,' which is the least he would have had.
The skipper was sent for life, having killed a
man in his arrest; but he didn't live six months
in prison; he never got over the tremendous blow
he received from Barney. All the reports spoke
of his being a receiver of 'stolen goods.' The Bank
paper was never mentioned, for the authorities
did not want to unsettle the public again, or let
them see what a narrow escape they had had.</p>

<p>And now comes about the queerest part of my
story. Call me names if I didn't stop the thieving
at Byrle's factory as well as recover the Bank
paper, killing two birds with one stone.</p>

<p>It was all through my catching the bony ferryman.
Finding that things was going hard with him,
and hoping to make them easier, and being disappointed
that those who were concerned with him
did not come forward with money to provide for
his defence, he 'rounded' on them; he split on
them all, and owned how he was the means of
taking the metal over to a fence on his side of the
water, the things being stolen by a mechanic and a
watchman who were in league. (I see I have used
the word 'fence;' this means a receiver of stolen
goods; but though I have been warned by the
editor of this magazine, we can't do without <i>some</i>
slang words.)</p>

<p>Peter Tilley got a tidy present, and was noted
for promotion through this business. I was glad of
it, for Peter was a capital chap&mdash;never wanted to
play first-fiddle; and I admire people of that disposition.
I tell you what I did: I got the newest
five-pound note of all what the Bank gave me, and
they were all very clean and crisp, and I wrapped
old Bob the gatekeeper's own sixpence in it; and
I went to the factory and I stood a pint of ale, and
says: 'Bob, here's your sixpence!' He hadn't
known exactly who I was till then, for I had
made excuses as usual; and then I'm blessed if
he didn't quite cry over his luck. Mr Byrle too
thought a lot of Bob's kindness, for I told the old
gent about it; and I heard that on that very
account he put six shillings a week on Bob's
wages, and I was glad to hear it.</p>

<p>They couldn't keep me off the detective staff
after this; and although I am free to confess&mdash;now
I am on my pension and nothing matters to me&mdash;that
I only stumbled upon these discoveries by
accident, I was praised to the skies by those for
whom I worked. However, it all died away, as
such things do; but I had managed to get my
house at Pentonville, as I have hinted; and a
pleasanter neighbourhood I don't know, or one
more convenient for getting about. I have had
some rather odd adventures since I have lived in
my street; you can't help seeing strange things, if
you keep your eyes open in London. But I didn't
begin to tell about <i>them</i>. I have finished my
account of the robberies at Byrle &amp; Co.'s and my
story finishes in consequence.</p>

<h2><a name="FEATS_OF_ENDURANCE" id="FEATS_OF_ENDURANCE">FEATS OF ENDURANCE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">London</span>, which has witnessed many strange doings
in its day, was lately the scene of the most
wonderful feats of pedestrianism ever accomplished
within a given period.</p>

<p>Every hour, day and night, for six weary weeks
a man plodded on his way round a measured
track, until the grand total of fifteen hundred
miles in one thousand hours had been made up,
finishing his self-imposed task with his physical
and mental faculties apparently unimpaired.</p>

<p>The task of walking fifteen hundred miles in a
thousand hours had never before been attempted,
and henceforth the new achievement will throw
into the cold shade of obscurity even the marvellous
act of walking a thousand miles in as many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_807" id="Page_807">{807}</a></span>
hours, which was once accomplished in 1809 by
Captain Robert Barclay of Ury, a Scotchman, who
proposed to perform the then incredible task of
walking a thousand miles in a thousand consecutive
hours. The proposition was received with
every sign of incredulity, though, when the affair
was finally arranged to take place, many thousands
of pounds were staked on the event. Newmarket
Heath was selected as the scene of the exploit, and
the famous walk began on the 1st of June 1809, at
midnight. It is unnecessary to repeat the details
of this feat; it will suffice to mention that the
enterprising captain completed his task on the 12th
July, at four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Since then, an attempt has, we believe, been
made to walk the same distance <i>backwards</i>; and
within the past twelve months, Weston, the American
pedestrian, has performed some remarkable
exploits of the kind; being however at last beaten
by an Irishman named Kelly.</p>

<p>The hero of the lately completed task (fifteen
hundred miles in a thousand hours) is a
little Welshman of not more than five feet three
and a half inches in height, and about forty-two
years of age; while in personal appearance
and general <i>physique</i> he presents anything but
what is usually supposed to be the characteristic
of a good pedestrian. His name is William Gale,
and he is a bookbinder by trade, living at Clerkenwell.</p>

<p>At the commencement of his task on Sunday
the 26th of August, he weighed no more than
eight stone four pounds (8 st. 4 lbs.); and from
that day until Saturday the 6th October, during
a portion of every hour day and night, he pursued
his monotonous way around the inclosure at Lillie
Bridge grounds, Brompton. When the attempt
was first announced, even those most acquainted
with pedestrian feats where great endurance was
required, expressed themselves dubious as to the
result; and in order to have a reliable record of
his proceedings, Gale requested the different sporting
papers to appoint competent men as judges&mdash;a
request which was at once generously complied
with.</p>

<p>Thus we have an official report of his great
exploit, and the public are enabled to judge for
themselves on the nature of the feat performed.
Gale's average pace appears to have been about
four miles an hour; but when he had reached his
thousandth mile he assumed a brave spurt, and
footed it in ten minutes, or at the rate of six
miles an hour. During the last few days of his
walking he started rather stiffly at first, owing
to the pain caused by the swelling of some
varicose veins in his left leg; but undaunted by
so great and manifest a disadvantage, and other
disadvantages which we shall presently refer to,
the gallant little Welshman 'plodded his weary
way' with a determined pluck that won the
admiration and applause of every one present.</p>

<p>On Friday the 5th October, the day before the
finish of the tramp, Dr Gant of the Royal Free
Hospital was called in to see this extraordinary
walker, and after examining his legs, he pronounced
Gale to be in excellent condition so far as
his physical powers were concerned; there being
no fever, the pulse only seventy, no murmur at
the heart; and the varicose veins which had been
the cause of so much pain to him, were rather
better than worse, having considerably decreased
in size. Perhaps the most remarkable part of the
performance is, that it has been accomplished on a
system of training which entirely sets at variance
all athletic rules, for Gale partook of no fixed
refreshment, neither did he have his meals at
stated hours. His chief food was plain mutton-chops;
and as an instance of how he varied his
dishes, his afternoon meal on Friday the 5th
October, which might have been either breakfast,
dinner, or supper (so irregular had he been in this
respect), consisted of a lobster and bread and
butter, followed by a fried sole, and one or two
cups of ordinarily strong tea. During the walk he
also drank a good deal of beer&mdash;not strong beer,
but the ale which is usually sold at fourpence per
quart, which he seemed to prefer to any other
kind, probably on account of its freedom from that
tendency to increase rather than assuage thirst, so
remarkably apparent in the stronger beers.</p>

<p>Many strange incidents occurred in the course
of the six weeks, which were calculated to while
away the time, and occasionally to bring a smile
to the pedestrian's lips. For instance, a certain
illustrated sheet, notorious for its very sensational
cartoons, published a picture of Gale on the track
followed by Old Time with the conventional
scythe on his shoulder; and many people it would
seem actually paid their money with the idea that
they were going to see the two figures as thus
represented. One man, who had evidently gone
to the grounds for this purpose, had watched Gale
go round the track several times, when he could
no longer control his disappointment. He shouted
aloud, angrily demanding his money back, because,
as he said with the greatest <i>naïveté</i> possible, 'the
beggar with the scythe hadn't turned up!'</p>

<p>As the last week of the great walking match
wore on, signs of weariness in the indomitable
pedestrian became painfully apparent, and many
persons began to fear that the task he had set
himself would after all remain unaccomplished.
On several of the rounds he fell asleep whilst
walking, and dropped to the ground; but this contact
with mother earth seemed to revive him
instantly, and he plodded on as pluckily as before.</p>

<p>At length success crowned his efforts; and at
seventeen minutes past five o'clock (less a second)
on Saturday afternoon the 6th October 1877, Gale
terminated his long and dreary walk in the presence
of a large, fashionable, and enthusiastic
assemblage, who rewarded his efforts with several
rounds of hearty applause.</p>

<p>From the commencement of his task to the
finish Gale bore up against all obstacles with extraordinary
pluck and determination, his last mile
being performed in <i>ten minutes and eight seconds</i>.
He was at once removed to the tent or pavilion
under which he had snatched so many brief half-hours'
rest, and was examined by three medical
men, who found that his heart was quite natural
in its movements, and that the temperature of his
body did not exceed one hundred and six degrees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_808" id="Page_808">{808}</a></span></p>

<p>The great feat which has thus been accomplished
without the aid of artificial training, is a marvellous
instance of what human endurance, allied with
courage and determination, can effect; though of
what particular benefit it may be to the world at
large it is utterly impossible to imagine.</p>


<p class='p2'>Since the preceding account was written, Gale
has accomplished a still more extraordinary feat,
and one which for strength of will and physical
endurance far surpasses his previous efforts. We
still fail, however, to see the benefit which
can accrue from exhibitions of this kind, and
well might he have been contented with the
laurels he had already won. He had scarcely
allowed himself time to recover from his former
task, when he once more appeared at a public
place of entertainment, namely the Agricultural
Hall at Islington, to walk four thousand quarter-miles
under the astounding condition, that it was
to be done in four thousand consecutive periods
of ten minutes.</p>

<p>This of course deprived him of the half-hour's
rest which he could obtain at one time in the
former race, and only allowed him a few minutes
between each round to get a little sleep. Despite
these drawbacks, however, Gale finished his task
at eleven o'clock <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> on the 17th November, after
a dreary walk of nearly four weeks. By accomplishing
his task, he has placed himself at the head
of all the famous pedestrians the world has known;
and we trust that this fact will be sufficient to
satisfy his craving after what is at best but
ephemeral fame.</p>

<p>Men have on many occasions attempted walking
feats which required a vast amount of physical
endurance, and have failed from their utter inability
to go without the natural quantum of sleep;
but Gale has not only shewn himself to be possessed
of the former, but to be altogether independent
of the latter. This, however, instead of
indicating 'pluck' merely, would rather seem to
point to a peculiarity in the man's constitution;
as there are doubtless many persons whose courage
would enable them to perform the same or even a
greater task if, like Gale, they could walk about
in a state of somnolency or semi-sleep&mdash;a state in
which, to use his own words, he was as one in a
dream, unconscious of all that was going on
around him, and believing himself to be walking
in forests and other places of silvan beauty; and
the truth of this was made evident by the fact that
he would have often exceeded the limit of his
walk had not the voice of his attendant aroused
him from his stupor.</p>

<p>The average time occupied by this extraordinary
walker was by day about three minutes for each
quarter of a mile, and by night about five minutes;
and the fastest round recorded was done in two
minutes and forty-two seconds. His pulse was
always found to indicate a perfect state of health,
and was as regular when he left off as when he
commenced his task. His food consisted principally
of fish, fowl, chops, eggs, and light puddings;
and his drink was, with only one exception during
the whole time, tea.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the
whole affair was the fact that, although he sank
into a deep sleep directly he reached his chair
behind the curtain, which hid him from view
between his walks, the moment the bell rang
the second time, he would appear as fresh as
ever and begin trudging away again.</p>

<p>When the feat was accomplished, Sir John
Astley stepped forward, and amid a scene of great
enthusiasm, presented the undaunted Welshman
with a silver belt of the value of a hundred guineas,
bearing the following inscription: 'This belt was
presented to <span class="smcap">William Gale</span> of Cardiff, on the 17th
November 1877, by some of the nobility and gentry
of Great Britain, in commemoration of his hitherto
unprecedented feat, namely walking one thousand
five hundred miles in one thousand hours at Lillie
Bridge Grounds, August 26th to October 6th, 1877;
and four thousand quarter-miles in four thousand
consecutive periods of ten minutes, at the Agricultural
Hall, London, October 21st to November 17th,

velvet, the metal portion of it weighing one hundred
ounces of sterling silver.</p>

<p>None will begrudge Gale his well-earned reward;
but it is to be hoped that such exhibitions will in
future be discountenanced by the general public,
as they not only detract from the dignity of man,
but are needless and unwarrantable in a country
which, we trust, will ever pride itself on a nobler
civilisation than that which is founded upon mere
physical endurance.</p>

<p class='ph3'>THE STORY OF TWO CHRISTMAS EVES.</p>


<h3 title='PROLOGUE.'>IN TWO CHAPTERS.&mdash;PROLOGUE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the gray light of an Indian dawn, with the
cool breeze blowing through the curtains of the
tent, and his friend's sorrowful eyes looking down on
him, a soldier lay on his rough couch&mdash;waiting for
death. They were soon to be parted those two, who
had lived and fought together; but the face of
the one who was starting on that journey of which
none has measured the distance, was smilingly
calm, while the eyes of the other glistened with
regretful tears as he spoke low, faltering, remorseful
words.</p>

<p>'Hush, Ralph, hush!' the other said at last.
'Don't you think, dear old fellow, I would sooner
lose my life in having saved yours, than in any
other way? After all, a few days or years sooner
or later, what does it signify? My fate is perhaps
the happiest, though I hope it is not. I don't
think life is so very desirable,' he continued; 'I
am only twenty-six; but mine has not been a
happy one. It was my own fault, though. Take
my advice, Ralph; don't marry young. There is
only one thing that troubles me'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Your little girl,' Ralph interrupted. 'Wrayworth,
let me take care of her; if I can make
her happy, it will be some slight atonement,
some'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'You would take care of her, Ralph? would
you?' The dying man's eyes shone gratefully as
he looked up in his friend's face. 'She has nothing,
poor little thing,' he went on sadly&mdash;'motherless,
fatherless, scarcely more than a baby either. It
would be a heavy charge to leave you, Ralph.'</p>

<p>'Wrayworth! how can you speak so; you will
drive me mad! You&mdash;you'&mdash;&mdash; He broke down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_809" id="Page_809">{809}</a></span>
utterly; it was something so terrible to see this
friend dying there&mdash;for him. 'Anything on earth
that I can do'&mdash;&mdash; he murmured.</p>

<p>'You will do for her,' said Wrayworth. 'Thank
you. I have no friends to send her to. I meant
to have made her very happy.'</p>

<p>'She shall be; I swear it!' Ralph answered
fervently, thankful for this charge, which might
in some degree help him to pay that debt of gratitude,
and forgetful that he had no control of fate,
that the promise he gave of happiness was a
fearfully presumptuous one. But he made it
willingly, gladly, solemnly, before God; and as
far as lay in his power it should sacredly be kept;
any sacrifice he would make for this child.</p>

<p>His friend's eyes rested on him searchingly for
a moment. 'I trust you,' he said&mdash;'I trust you.'</p>

<p>The hours passed on, the blazing sun arose, and
Ralph went out into the burning glare with
bent head and staggering footsteps, while words
he had heard long since seemed floating round
him in letters of fire: 'Greater love hath no man
than this, that a man lay down his life for his
friend.'&mdash;'Is there <i>none</i> greater?' he thought. 'Is
there nothing <i>I</i> can do to repay&mdash;nothing?'</p>


<h3>CHAPTER I.&mdash;ASKED.</h3>

<p>The years were well on in their teens since
that melancholy scene was enacted in the Indian
tent&mdash;since Wrayworth consigned his only child
to the guardianship of the friend whose life, at
the expense of his own, he had saved on the
battle-field. A carriage rolled along the snowy
high-road through the cold clear air; the short
winter's day was drawing to its close, and up in
the darkening sky the stars were beginning to
shine upon the world's most joyful season, upon
Christmas eve. The world's most joyful season?
We call it so, this festival, more than eighteen
hundred years old; but does the world think it so?&mdash;the
world, with its thousand cares and crosses,
its deep and hidden sorrows, its partings and its
tears? Of those amongst the myriads who keep
the Yule-tide feast, how many hold it with a
chastened joy! For on that day most of all our
thoughts go back to other years, to other faces, to
other lips that have wished us 'a merry Christmas;'
to other hands, which have clasped ours so
loyally, to those who have loved us so long ago!</p>

<p>But Major Loraine had no sad memories connected
with the season as he drove up to the old
house, from which duty had so frequently called
him, and which he had not seen for five years. In
the wide, dark, panelled hall his step-mother
stood waiting to welcome him, as gladly as though
he had been her own son. He was only a boy
when she first came there, when the pink was
fresh on her cheek and the gold bright in her
hair; they had been drawn to each other then;
and through the long years of her widowhood his
loving care had helped to lighten her load of
sorrow; so it was not wonderful that for months
past she had been eagerly looking forward to his
return.</p>

<p>The greetings over, they sat down side by side,
talking, as those talk after long separation, of past,
present, and future; of their acquaintances married,
dead, or far away; of things on the estate, prosperous
or failures; of the ball to be given next month,
of the one they were going to, to-night; of how
much Emma was improved since she 'came out,'
how Katharine was considered one of the handsomest
girls in the place, and how she might
marry Sir Michael Leyland with thirty thousand
a year if she liked.</p>

<p>'But why ever doesn't she like?' asked the
Major, astonished at this new phase in the character
of his worldly-minded sister.</p>

<p>'That is just what troubles me,' answered Mrs
Loraine. 'They are all at the church now, helping
to decorate. Louise wanted to stay at home to
welcome you, but I sent them all off, so as to have
you to myself for an hour. You will see a great
alteration in Louise, Ralph.'</p>

<p>'Shall I, mother?' he said smiling. 'I think
not. Her letters are the same always; they have
altered in style a little of course in the last year
or two, but it is the same spirit&mdash;the same
creature.'</p>

<p>'But not the same face, Ralph. Remember you
have not seen her for five years, which have not
altered you, but which have changed her from an
unformed girl of fourteen to a lovely woman;
with that bright changing beauty, which has
more charm for a man than regularity of feature.
It is a very difficult question.'</p>

<p>'What is a difficult question?' asked Ralph, as
his mother paused.</p>

<p>'What to do with Louise.'</p>

<p>'You hinted something of the kind in your last
letter, mother,' he said gravely. 'I am sorry, but
I must confess this house seems large enough for
four women. You know how I am situated; you
know the promise which binds me. But tell me,'
he added smiling, 'what has Louise done? She
seemed to me gentle and tractable enough when I
was last at home.'</p>

<p>'I have not the slightest fault to find,' Mrs
Loraine replied; 'you know I am very fond of
her. You will think my difficulty very womanish;
simply, Louise is too pretty.'</p>

<p>'And some one has told her so,' said Ralph,
laughing. 'Go on.'</p>

<p>'It is not that; but I cannot bear to see my own
child's happiness destroyed by another, who, if not
a stranger, has at least no claim upon her.'</p>

<p>Ralph frowned slightly. 'Perhaps not,' he
answered; 'the claim is upon me, and it is a sacred
one. So,' he continued, 'it is a case of rivals, I see.'</p>

<p>'Simply this, Ralph. You remember the Levesons
of Leigh Court, where we are going to-night?
Their eldest son is in the &mdash;th Dragoons, and
has been home on leave. Louise was away when
he first came here, and he appeared very much
struck with Katharine; and no wonder; she is
very handsome. Well&mdash;don't laugh at me; I don't
like match-making as a rule; but I thought as she
seemed interested in him, there was no harm in
inviting him sometimes. But as soon as Louise
came home, he transferred his attentions to her.
Katharine says nothing; but it makes a kind of
awkwardness between them. I know she feels it,
poor child; though indeed I believe Vere Leveson
is simply flirting with Louise.'</p>

<p>Major Loraine laughed. 'Poor mother!' he
said, 'you will have enough to do if you take all
your children's love affairs to heart so seriously.
These things always right themselves, you know.
But I confess I am surprised to hear of Katharine
going in for sentiment; I should have thought Sir
Michael more in her line. Is that all, mother?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_810" id="Page_810">{810}</a></span></p>

<p>'No; only the first of my difficulties,' she
answered half sadly. 'You know what my health
has been for the last few years; you know&mdash;&mdash; Well,
you do not wish me to speak of that; but it is
better to look in the face of possibility. Suppose
anything happened to me, Ralph, what would
become of Louise?'</p>

<p>'You speak of what I hope may be far distant,
mother,' he answered tenderly. 'But why should
you be uneasy about her? In the event of her not
marrying, she would always have a home here
with me.'</p>

<p>Mrs Loraine shook her head. 'Turn round and
look in the glass,' she said; 'thirty-nine is not
such a very formidable age.'</p>

<p>He turned, and contemplated his bronzed face in
the glass; such a handsome, noble face, telling of a
nature that could not act falsely or meanly. The
broad square forehead, marred by a sabre-cut, and
the dark hair flecked here and there, by the Indian
sun, with gray; nothing else to find fault with in
the frank kind smile, the fine regular features, the
dark true eyes.</p>

<p>'I think there is no fear of my being taken for
younger than I am, mother,' he said, smiling.</p>

<p>'It is an awkward position for you, though,' she
answered; 'and as I said, a difficult question
what to do. We must hope for the best, Ralph.
You are going to join the others now, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Yes; I think I can find my way.'</p>

<p>He went out into the keen frosty air, walking
slowly, though it was unpleasantly cold to one
accustomed to tropical climates. He was thinking
over his mother's words, and knew she was right
as to the awkwardness of the position. He saw
the peace of the household was troubled, without
knowing how to set matters right, and he thought
of the old friend who had trusted his child to him.
He had vowed she should be happy, and now it
seemed a difficult vow to keep; but for the sake of
the man who had died for him sixteen long years
ago, the pledge then given must be redeemed.</p>

<p>Louise Wrayworth's life had been a bright one
hitherto; her guardian's home was the only one she
could remember, and he had striven to fill in some
degree her father's place. To him, from infancy
to womanhood, she had looked up with loving
grateful reverence, regarding him, present or
absent, as the noblest of created beings.</p>

<p>He reached the old church, and made his way
round to the open vestry door. The steps were
encumbered with bundles of evergreens; the voices
of the workers, who had finished their task, were
audible. He pushed the door further open, and
went in. The floor was covered with boughs, and
around the pillars were wreathed holly and other
evergreens in honour of the joyous season. Some
of the choristers stood waiting for the choir-practice,
and the organist was softly playing <i>Adeste
Fideles</i>.</p>

<p>'Ralph!' cried a young fresh voice; and a
slight fair girl with a merry face sprang up from
the floor, with her hands full of the scarlet berries,
which fell hither and thither in bright-hued rain,
as with complete indifference to the by-standers,
she gave the returned soldier a sisterly embrace.
'You dear old thing to come for us!' she exclaimed.</p>

<p>'Emma, Emma!' exclaimed Ralph, laughing and
disengaging himself; 'you have not learned to
behave any better in five years.'</p>

<p>But his young sister had vanished, and he
turned to greet the vicar; and one or two of the
ladies he recognised. In a few minutes Emma
reappeared; and behind her came a tall fair
girl with masses of golden hair, and great beautiful
cold blue eyes. She greeted Major Loraine
affectionately, but with the quiet stately grace
habitual to her. Five years had not changed
Katharine Loraine; at twenty-four she was still
the same majestic Queen Katharine as at nineteen,
with whom he had always had so little
sympathy, whose nature he had found so difficult
to understand.</p>

<p>'Where is Louise?' he asked presently. 'Is she
not here?'</p>

<p>'She went into the churchyard just now,'
answered Emma, 'to put a wreath on Nellie
Bryant's grave. You remember her, Ralph?'</p>

<p>'Louise's friend? Yes.'</p>

<p>'A <i>triste</i> employment for Christmas eve,' observed
one of the gentlemen decorators to Katharine,
as he stooped to disentangle her dress from a
long sprig of ivy.</p>

<p>'Oh, Mr Leveson went to hold a lantern for her,'
Katharine answered, with the slightest possible
shade of contempt in the silvery tones of her
voice; 'and Louise is never <i>triste</i>, unless she is
by herself.'</p>

<p>The choir was now fully assembled; the organist
struck up the anthem, the rest were silent to
listen, and Ralph Loraine went out to look for his
ward. He came round the east end of the old
church, and stood still for a moment in the
shadow. There were two people standing at the
edge of the path, looking down on the grave at
their feet, where the lantern's light shewed the
shining holly upon the upright marble cross. It
shewed too the face of his friend's child; a beautiful
face, as his step-mother had said, with large
dark eyes and wavy dusky hair, a clear delicate
complexion with a little rose-flush on the cheeks,
and full red lips half-parted by the sweetest smile
he had ever seen; with the same erect carriage of
the head, the same fearless straight regard which
had characterised her father.</p>

<p>It was so strange to see her there a woman,
whom he had left a mere girl; and as he looked
on the fair face, something seemed to whisper that
the ideal beauty he had so often dreamed of was
before him at last. They moved away, and came
slowly nearer, and paused again where he could
see her companion; and for a moment he almost
hated the man for his youth, and his handsome
face, and the deep-blue eyes aflame with passion-fire
as they rested on the child of his dead friend;
and another whisper which silenced the first, told
him how fitted was each for the other.</p>

<p>'If <i>I</i> were lying there,' said Vere Leveson, and
Ralph could hear every one of the foolish, softly
spoken words, 'would you ever make wreaths for
<i>me</i>, I wonder?'</p>

<p>'I don't know.'</p>

<p>'Don't you? I wish you did; for I thought just
now I should be glad to be lying there, if you
would remember me.'</p>

<p>Ralph had heard enough, and tried to slip away
unseen; but the gravel crunched under his feet
and betrayed him.</p>

<p>Louise started, and a bright vivid blush covered
her face as she sprang forward. 'Lorrie! Oh, how
glad I am to see you again!' she cried, as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_811" id="Page_811">{811}</a></span>
took both his hands in hers and lifted her cheek
for his kiss.</p>

<p>He felt half sorry she had done so; that and
the old childish name put him immediately in
his place as guardian, and made him ashamed of
his thoughts. 'How you are altered, Louise!' he
said, looking down at her admiringly. 'I think I
should hardly have known you!'</p>

<p>'I should have known you, Lorrie, anywhere,'
she said reproachfully.</p>

<p>'That is rather different,' he said; 'when we
once get old, we don't change so quickly.'</p>

<p>'You would not like it if I said you were old,
Lorrie. But tell me, am <i>I</i> altered for the worse?
or'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'You have no need to come to me for compliments,
surely,' he said smiling.</p>

<p>'I should think more of yours than of any one's,'
she whispered, with that sweet dangerous smile;
a smile which a man like Ralph Loraine should
have taken as a warning not to feel its influence
too often.</p>

<p>'How rude I am!' she said at last.&mdash;'Mr Leveson,
do you know my guardian?' She turned to her
companion, who stood holding the lantern a few
yards from them.</p>

<p>'I had the honour of dining in your company
once, Major Loraine,' he answered, stepping forward.
'It is some time ago, when I first joined at Madras;
but I well remember my anxiety to see such a
distinguished soldier as yourself.'</p>

<p>There was a ring of truth and honest admiration
in the words, which raised them above an
ordinary compliment, and which made Ralph
hold out his hand and answer cordially: 'I have
a bad memory for faces, or I think I should have
remembered yours.'</p>

<p>'Thanks,' said Vere, laughing. 'We shall have
the pleasure of seeing you to-night, I hope?'</p>

<p>'Yes; my mother told me of the invitation.'</p>

<p>'Of course he is coming,' said Louise. 'And
you will dance with me all the evening, Lorrie;
won't you?'</p>

<p>'Not quite all, Miss Wrayworth; please, don't
forget my waltzes,' said Vere, holding out his
hand. 'I must be off now; so good-bye for the
present. You won't forget?'</p>

<p>She looked up quickly. 'Perhaps,' the lips said
laughingly; but the dark eyes gave a sweet silent
answer Ralph did not see, though he was watching
them. But after Vere Leveson had gone, he
walked home beneath the Christmas stars, with
Louise's hand resting on his arm, dreaming as he
went, a fair, fond, foolish dream.</p>


<p class='p2'>The Christmas-eve ball at Leigh Park was a
regular institution, one which Sir Harry Leveson
had kept up for years. It was a pretty sight,
Ralph thought, as he stood leaning against a
window, and looking round to select a partner.
And amongst all the fair women, the one he
thought the fairest was his young ward Louise
Wrayworth, in her white floating dress, with its
wreaths of holly, and the red clustering berries in
her dark hair.</p>

<p>Ralph had been watching Vere Leveson, trying
to decide in his own mind whether Mrs Loraine's
verdict of flirtation was a just one; and he
judged that it was; for the attentions of the young
officer were apparently equally divided between
Louise and Katharine. Ralph did not happen to
be near when, later on, he led Louise to one of
the cool empty rooms, where through the open
window could be heard the merry Christmas bells.
He did not see the hand-clasp or the light that
flashed in the eyes of each. He did not hear the
hurried whisper: 'Louise, you won't forget me,
you will trust me till next Christmas-time?'</p>

<p>The ball was over, the rooms were dark and
silent; the whole world waited for the sun to
rise on Christmas-day.</p>

<h2><a name="IS_THE_TELEPHONE_A_PRACTICAL" id="IS_THE_TELEPHONE_A_PRACTICAL">IS THE TELEPHONE A PRACTICAL
SUCCESS?</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> September last appeared in this <i>Journal</i> an
article entitled 'Singing and Talking by Telegraph;'
and in that paper we attempted to describe
the mechanism of that wonderful little instrument
the telephone. It is now our purpose to say something
regarding the progress that has been made
towards perfecting the invention; but in order to
make the article as clear as possible, we venture
once more upon a few words explanatory of the
instrument.</p>

<p>The telephone as it is now made is an exceedingly
simple-looking apparatus similar in appearance
to a stethoscope; to the handle of a girl's
skipping-rope; or better still, to a large-sized
penny wooden trumpet. Inside this hollow cylinder,
and within an inch or so of the wider end, is
fixed a plate of iron as thin as a well-worn sixpence,
and about the size of a half-crown piece.
This is called the diaphragm. Behind the diaphragm,
nearly touching it, and extending to the
narrower end of the cylinder, is a piece of 'soft'
iron enveloped in wire coils, with a permanent
magnet beyond. Outside the narrower end of the
cylinder, and communicating with the coils that
surround the iron inside, are attached two screws
or 'terminals,' which are 'joined up' to a main
wire, communicating with the distant or receiving
telephone wherever that may be, and which is
precisely similar to the one we have described.
When we apply our mouth to the bell-shaped
end of the apparatus, and speak or shout or sing,
we set the diaphragm vibrating as in a tuning-fork;
the vibrations thus created are electrically
communicated through the wire to a distant
telephone, and are repeated on its diaphragm
with more or less distinctness.</p>

<p>It is known that the motion of an iron plate
contiguous to the poles of a magnet creates a
disturbance of electricity in coils surrounding
those poles; and the duration of this current
will coincide with the vibratory motion of the
plate or diaphragm. When, therefore, the human
voice (or any other suitable sound) impinges
through the tube against this diaphragm, the
diaphragm begins to vibrate, and awakens, so
to speak, electrical action in the coils of wire
surrounding the poles of the magnet; not a current,
but a series of undulations, something like
those produced by the voice in the air around us.
In short the telephone is an apparatus designed
to transmit sound through a wire of indefinite
length; the voice being, so to speak, 'converted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_812" id="Page_812">{812}</a></span>
into electricity at one end, the electricity becoming
voice at the other.'</p>

<p>With these few explanatory remarks, we now
proceed to offer to our readers the following interesting
experiments made by a gentleman well
skilled in telegraphy.</p>

<p>'Journalists,' he says, 'with no special knowledge
of the difficulties the invention has to
encounter as a telegraph instrument, have expatiated
in such enthusiastic terms upon the results
said to have been achieved by the telephone, that
a somewhat exaggerated notion of its powers
and capabilities has been accepted by the general
public. It appears, therefore, to the writer of those
lines that a statement of the experiences of a
person practically engaged in the work of telegraphy
may assist in placing the phenomena of
the telephone on a proper footing.</p>

<p>'Scientifically, the telephone is a great and
undoubted success; and a person would be grievously
in error if, because of some undoubted
hindrances to its practical use, he pronounced it
unworthy of further experiment. The emergence
of telegraphy from the domain of experiment
into that of daily practical use is a fact so
undoubted, and one with which we are now so
familiar, that it is impossible to say at what
moment the telephone, at present a scientific toy,
may become a daily necessity not only of telegraphic
but of ordinary commercial work.</p>

<p>'Being engaged in daily contact with a large
telegraphic centre, and in association with men
who have the command of every means of testing
the invention in a practical work-a-day manner,
the writer was able to gauge pretty accurately the
range within which the telephone can work. It
must be understood, however, that in recording
the effects observed by him and his associates, he
has no desire to invalidate, or even to call in question
the experiences of others who may have been
able to arrive at better results. The telephone is
in the hands of some of the first electricians and
telegraphists of the day, and differences of conditions
(not to speak of differences of capacity on
the part of the operator) may give variety in
the observations made. The very difficulties and
drawbacks now to be recorded will no doubt some
day suggest to a master-mind the method by which
they may be overcome. But till that day arrives,
the telephone must be content to remain where
the writer leaves it, an undoubted success from
a scientific point of view, but overwhelmed with
obstacles to its practical use, in this country at
least, in general telegraphy.</p>

<p>'When a telegraphist first gets into his hand
this beautifully simple and electrically delicate instrument,
his first inclination is to test its carrying-power.
This is of course a closet experiment,
not working with actual telegraph line, but
with "resistance" equivalent to a telegraph line of
stated length. An experiment of this nature gives
better results than could be obtained by a veritable
line, because the insulation is, so to speak, perfect.
No leakage at undesigned points of contact, or
disturbance from unfavourable atmospheric conditions,
is felt, and the experiment is entirely under
the observer's control. The apparatus used is
designed to offer the same labour for the electric
current to overcome, as would be offered by a
stated length of outside telegraph line. This
artificial resistance is nicely graduated, and as
the method of testing was suggested by Ohm, a
German electrician, the unit of resistance is, as
we once previously explained, termed an "ohm."
Removing the telephone to such a distance that
the two observers were "out of earshot," the test
with resistance was tried, and with a resistance of
one thousand ohms&mdash;roughly speaking, equal to
seventy miles of a well-constructed line&mdash;the sound
was perfect, although not very loud. Every articulation
of the speaker at the other end could be distinguished
so long as silence was maintained in the
room, or so long as no heavy lorry rumbling over
the stones outside sent in harsh noises which
drowned the faint whisper of the instrument. The
resistance was gradually raised to four thousand
ohms&mdash;nearly three hundred miles&mdash;with like
favourable results; and for some little distance
beyond, articulation could still be made out. But
by the time ten thousand ohms had been applied,
putting the speaker at a distance of, say, seven
hundred miles, sound only, but not articulate
sound, reached the ear. The tone was there, and
every inflection of the voice could be followed;
but articulation was absent, although the listener
strove every nerve to catch the sound, which the
speaker, as was afterwards ascertained, was shouting
in a loud clear voice. The prolonged notes of
an air sung could be heard with the resistance
named, but again no words could be distinguished.
The voice, whether in speaking or singing, has a
weird curious sound in the telephone. It is in
a measure ventriloqual in character; and with
the telephone held an inch or two from the ear,
it has the effect as if some one were singing far
off in the building, or the sound were coming up
from a vaulted cellar or through a massive stone
wall.</p>

<p>'Proceeding to our next experiment, we joined
up the telephones in one office to several wires
in succession, putting ourselves in circuit with
lines going to various distances and working with
different instruments. When this was done, the
real obstacle to telephonic progress at once asserted
itself in the shape of "induction." The first wire
experimented with was partly "overhouse" and
partly underground, and the offices upon it were
working Wheatstone A B C instruments. It is
difficult to render clear to the person ignorant of
telegraphic phenomena the idea expressed by the
word <i>induction</i>. Briefly it may be put thus, that
when a strong electric current is passing on a
wire, it has the faculty of setting up a current of
opposite character in any wire not then working,
or working with a feebler current, that may be in
its vicinity. The why or the wherefore cannot be
explained, but there is the fact.</p>

<p>'In various recent articles on the telephone,
mention has been made of "contact" as the cause
of disturbance. This word, however, although it
has been used by telegraphists, is misleading, and
can only be used as an endeavour to express popularly
an electric fact. Actual contact of one wire
with another would spoil the business altogether.
A wire bearing an electric current seems to be for
the time surrounded, to an undefined distance, by
an electric atmosphere, and all wires coming
within this atmosphere have a current in an opposite
direction set up in them. This is as near an
explanation of the phenomena of induction as the
state of telegraph science at present affords. Now
the telephone works with a very delicate magnetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_813" id="Page_813">{813}</a></span>
current, and is easily overpowered by the action of
a stronger current in any wire near which the telephone
wire may come. To work properly it
"requires a silent line."</p>

<p>'In the place where the observations were made,
there are a large number of wires, travelling
under the floor, through the test-box, along
passages to the battery-room and to a pole on
the outside, whence they radiate, or out to
a pipe underground, where many gutta-percha-covered
wires lie side by side. On applying
the ear to a telephone joined into a circuit
working in such an office a curious sound is heard,
comparable most nearly to the sound of a pot
boiling. But the practised ear could soon separate
the boiling into distinct sounds. There was one
masterful Morse instrument&mdash;probably on the wire
lying nearest the one on which we were joined up&mdash;whose
peremptory "click, cli-i-i-ck, click," representing
"dot, dash, dot" on the printed slip we read
from, could be heard over all. Then there was
the rapid whir of a Wheatstone fast-speed transmitter,
sending dots and dashes at express speed
by mechanical means; the sharp well-pronounced
rattle in sounds of equal length of a needle instrument;
and most curious of all, the "rrrrr-op, rr-op,
rrrrrrrrrrrrr-op, rrrrr-op, rr-op" of the A B C, the
deadliest foe to the telephone in its endeavours to
gain admission into the family of telegraph instruments.
There may be reason in this, for as the
Wheatstone A B C is the instrument used for
private telegraphy, or for the least important
public offices, because it requires no "code" to
be learned by the manipulator, so it would likely
be the first to be displaced if an acoustic telegraph
permanently took the field. So the sentient little
A B C opens its mitrailleuse fire on the intruder,
on whose delicate currents, in the words of an
accomplished electrician, it plays "old harry." The
peculiar character of the sounds we borrow on the
telephone from this instrument arises from the
fact that as the needle flies round the dial, a
distinct current or pulsation passes for each letter,
and the final "op" we have tried to represent shews
the stoppage of the needle at the letters as words
were spelled out.</p>

<p>'It must not be understood that the <i>sounds</i>
of those various instruments are actually heard
in the telephone. What happens is, that the
currents stealing along the telephone wire by
induction produce vibrations in the diaphragm
of that instrument, the little metal membrane
working on the magnet in ready response to
every current set up in the latter. When it
is remembered that the principle of the telephone
is that the sound-caused vibrations in the
filmy diaphragm at one end create similar but
magnetically-caused vibrations in the diaphragm
at the other end, and so reproduce the sound, it
will be obvious why the rapid roll of the A B C
currents, or the swift sending of the fast-speed
transmitter, when brought by induction into the
telephone wire, cause disturbances in the sound
vibrations, and thereby cripple the instrument.
One instrument of either kind named would have
a certain effect, but one Morse or single needle
would not have any greatly prejudicial effect. But
a number of Morses or needles going together,
such as were heard in our experiments, would
combine to be nearly as bad as one A B C or fast-speed
Morse. So delicate is the diaphragm to
sound (and necessarily so), that in all experiments
with the telephone itself, such as those with "resistance,"
or those made at home to test the instrument
apart from telegraphic considerations, every
sound from without broke in, giving an effect like
the well-known "murmur of the shell."</p>

<p>'Joining up our wire now to a more distant
station at some miles along the railway, and
having on its poles a number of what are
known as "heavy" circuits, the pot-boiling sound
assumed even more marked characteristics. The
A B C no longer affected us; but a number of
Morse instruments were in full gear, and the fast-speed
transmitter was also at work. While we
were listening, the circuit to which we were joined
began to work, and the effect was literally electrical.
Hitherto we had only borrowed currents&mdash;or,
seeing they were so unwelcome, we might
call them currents thrust upon us&mdash;and the
sounds, though sharp and incessant, were gentle
and rather low. But when the strong current was
set up in the wire itself, the listener who held
one of our telephones nearly jumped from the
floor when an angry "pit-<i>pat</i>, pit-<i>pat</i>, pit-<i>pat</i>-pit"
assailed his ear, causing him to drop the instrument
as if he had been shot! It was a result none
of us had expected, for it did not seem possible
that the delicate metal diaphragm and the little
magnet of the telephone could produce a sound so
intense. Of course it was only intense when the
ear was held close to the orifice of the instrument.
Held in the hand away from the ear, the telephone
now made a first-rate "sounder," and we could tell
without difficulty not only the signals that were passing,
but found in it a more comfortable tone than
that given by the Morse sounder in common use.</p>

<p>'Other experiments of a like character led to
results so similar, that they may be left unnoticed;
and we proceed now to describe one of a different
character, designed to test the telephone itself. At
a distance of about half a mile, access was obtained
to a Morse instrument in private use, and joined
to the office by "overhouse" wire. Dividing our
party and arranging a programme of operations,
two remained with a telephone in the office, while
other two, of whom the writer was one, proceeded
with the second telephone to the distant instrument.
By an arrangement which a practical telegraphist
will understand, the key of the Morse
was kept in circuit, so that signals could be exchanged
in that way. It may be noticed, however,
that this was hardly necessary, as the diaphragm
of the telephone can be used as a key, with the
finger or a blunt point, so that dot and dash signals
are interchangeable, should the voice fail to be
heard. As the wire in this instance travelled
almost alone over part of its course, we were in
hopes that induced currents would be conspicuous
by their absence. In this we were, however, disappointed,
for the pot was boiling away, rather more
faintly, but with the "plop-plop-plop" distinctly
audible, and once more a sharp masterful Morse
click was heard coming in now and again. The
deadly A B C was, however, absent, so that our
experiment proved highly successful. For some
reason or another&mdash;probably an imperfect condition
of the wire, or the effects of "induction" over and
above what made itself audible to us&mdash;the spoken
sounds were deficient in distinctness; but songs
sung at either end were very beautifully heard,
and indeed the sustained note of sung words had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_814" id="Page_814">{814}</a></span>
always a better carrying-power than rapidly spoken
words. Every syllable, and every turn of melody
of such a song as <i>My Mother bids me bind my Hair</i>,
sung by a lady at one end, or <i>When the Heart of
a Man</i>, sung at the other, could be distinctly
heard, but with the effect before noticed, that the
voice was muffled or shut in, as if the singer
were in a cellar, while it was not always possible
to say at once whether the voice was that of a
man or a woman.</p>

<p>'In the course of some domestic experiments,
it was remarked that in playing the scale downwards
from C in alt. on the piano, the result
to the listener was a "tit" only for the four
upper notes, although all below that had a clear
"ting," and the octaves below were mostly distinct,
although at the low notes of the piano the sound
was again lost. The ringing notes of a musical
box were not so successful, but with close attention,
its rapid execution of <i>Tommy Dodd</i> could be
well enough made out. An endeavour was made
to catch the ticking of a watch, but this was
not successful, and the experiment is not recommended,
as the near presence of a watch to
a magnet is not desirable; and the watch exposed
to it in this instance was, it is thought, affected
for a short time thereafter, although it received
no permanent damage.</p>

<p>'The observations made in the course of these
experiments convinced those present that the
telephone presents facilities for the dangerous
practice of "tapping the wires," which may make
it useful or dangerous, according as it is used
for proper or improper purposes. It might be an
important addition for a military commander to
make to his flying cavalry; as an expert sound-reader,
accompanying a column sent to cut off
the enemy's telegraph connections, might precede
the act of destruction by robbing him of some
of his secrets. The rapidity and simplicity of the
means by which a wire could be "milked," without
being cut or put out of circuit, struck the
whole of the party engaged in the various trials
that are described above. Of course the process of
tapping by telephone could not be carried out
if the instrument in use was an A B C or single
needle, or if the wire was being worked duplex
or with a fast-speed Morse, for in these cases
the sounds are too rapid or too indefinite to be
read by ear. The danger is thus limited to
ordinary sounder or Morse telegraphs; but these
still form the mainstay of every public system.</p>

<p>'Since the trials above described were made, the
newspapers have recorded a beautiful application
by Sir William Thomson, of the electric part of
the telephone to exhibit at a distance the motions
of an anemometer; the object being to shew the
force of air-currents in coal-mines. This is a
useful application of an electric fact, and doubtless
points the way to further discoveries. But
it is to be noticed that the experiment, interesting
as it is, hardly comes under the head of a tele<i>phone</i>,
what is reproduced at a distance being not sound
but motion.</p>

<p>'Obviously the invention cannot rest where it
is; and no one more readily than the practical
telegraphist will welcome an instrument at once
simple, direct, and reliable. Even in its present
form the telephone may be successfully used
where its wire is absolutely <i>isolated</i> from all other
telegraph wires. But the general impression is
that its power of reproducing the sound must be
intensified before its use can become general even
as a substitute in works or offices for the speaking-tube.'</p>

<h2><a name="SINGING_MICE" id="SINGING_MICE">SINGING MICE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">These</span> interesting animals are said to be smaller
than ordinary mice, to be usually of a brownish
colour, and to have long ears. Naturalists have
not come to any exact reason as to why they
sing. Some persons impute the singing to
disease, as in the wheezing of any one from
a cold. Others attribute it to an internal parasite.
But these seem unsatisfactory explanations;
for when the little creatures sing they are as
lively as common domestic mice. The faculty
of singing in a small way with various modulations
appears to be quite natural to the animals.
It has been noticed that during their musical performances
there is a throbbing in the throat, and
that the snout is elevated in giving play to the
voice, as in the warbling of birds. The song or
warble of these mice is said to be sweet and varied.
Hitherto not much attention has been given by
zoologists to the phenomenon; but we observe by
various notices in <i>Land and Water</i> and in <i>Nature</i>,
two periodicals devoted to pleasant discussions on
subjects of natural history, &amp;c., that singing mice
are becoming objects of careful investigation.</p>

<p>An amusing account of a singing mouse appears
in <i>Nature</i>, Nov. 9, from the pen of Mr Joseph
Sidebotham, dating from Menton, south of France.</p>

<p>'Last winter we occupied the rooms we now do
at Menton. Early in February we heard as we
thought the song of a canary, and fancied it was
outside our balcony; however, we soon discovered
that the singing was in our <i>salon</i>, and that the
songster was a mouse. At that time the weather
was rather cold, and we had a little fire, and the
mouse spent most of the day under the fender,
where we kept it supplied with bits of biscuit. In
a few days it became quite tame, and would come
on the hearth in an evening and sing for several
hours. Sometimes it would climb up the chiffonier
and ascend a vase of flowers to drink at the water,
and then sit and sing on the edge of the table and
allow us to go quite near to it without ceasing its
warble. One of its favourite haunts was the wood-basket,
and it would often sit and sing on the edge
of it. On February 12, the last night of the
Carnival, we had a number of friends in our <i>salon</i>,
and the little mouse sang most vigorously, much
to their delight and astonishment, and was not in
the least disturbed by the talking. In the evening
the mouse would often run about the room and
under the door into the corridor and adjoining
rooms, and then return to its own hearth. After
amusing us for nearly a month, it disappeared;
and we suspect it was caught in a trap set in one
of the rooms beyond. The mouse was small and
had very large ears, which it moved about much
whilst singing. The song was not unlike that of
the canary in many of its trills, and it sang quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_815" id="Page_815">{815}</a></span>
as beautifully as any canary, but it had more
variety, and some of its notes were much lower,
more like those of the bullfinch. One great
peculiarity was a sort of double song, which we
had now and then&mdash;an air with an accompaniment.
The air was loud and full, the notes
being low and the accompaniment quite subdued.
Some of our party were sure that there
was more than one mouse, until we had the
performance from the edge of the wood-basket
and were within a yard or two of it. My son
has suggested that many or all mice may have
the same power, but that the notes are usually
so much higher in the scale that, like the cry
of the dormouse and the bat, they are at the
verge of the pitch to which the human ear is
sensitive. This may be so; but the notes of our
mouse were so low, and even the highest so far
within the limits of the human ear, that I am
inclined to think the gift of singing in mice is but
of very rare occurrence.'</p>

<p>In the same periodical, the following additional
particulars as regards singing mice are presented
by Mr George J. Romanes, Regent's Park.</p>

<p>'Several years ago I received some of these animals
from a friend, and kept them in confinement for
one or two months. The description which your
correspondent gives of their performance leaves
very little to be added by me, as in all respects this
description agrees perfectly with my own observations.
I write, however, to remark one curious
fact about the singing of these mice, namely, that
it seemed to be evoked by two very opposite
sets of conditions. When undisturbed, the little
animals used for the most part to remain quiet
during the day, and begin to sing at night; but if
at any time they were alarmed, by handling them
or otherwise, whether during the day or night,
they were sure to sing vigorously. Thus the
action seemed to be occasioned either by contentment
or by fear. The character of the song, however,
was slightly different in the two cases.</p>

<p>'That these mice did not learn this art from
singing birds there can be no doubt, for they were
captured in a house where no such birds were kept.
It may be worth while to add that this house
(a London one) seemed to have been suddenly
invaded, so to speak, by a number of these animals,
for although my friend has lived in this house
since the year 1862, it was only during a few
months that singing mice were heard in it, and
during these few months they were heard in considerable
numbers.'</p>

<p>As corroborative of the foregoing notices, we
give the following very interesting account of a
singing mouse, obligingly sent to us by a correspondent,
Mr Alfred Wright.</p>

<p>'In the early spring of last year I was invited
by an old widow lady to see a singing mouse,
which she had at night heard singing and scratching
beneath the floor of her bed, and been so fortunate
as to catch in a trap. I went, and found the
little animal in a cage with a revolving wheel,
similar to that in which a squirrel is usually confined.
Whether the mouse was shy at the presence
of a stranger, I do not know. It remained silent;
but at length, after my patience had been nearly
exhausted, it began to sing in clear warbling notes
like those of a bird. When I called the next
evening to hear the mouse again, I heard him to
perfection; and was so filled with interest in the
novelty, that I begged permission to bring any
friend who was a sceptic of the fact, or who might
desire to see the phenomenon. My request was
readily granted. One friend of course had heard
of a singing mouse, but he certainly would not
allow that a prolonged squeak was a song&mdash;not
he! Another friend of course had heard a mouse
sing when he was a boy; but he was told, he
perfectly well remembered, that the <i>noise</i> produced
by the mouse was the result of some
internal disease. Well, both of these went with
me to hear the little creature. Unfortunately, at
first it was again shy; but after an interval of
silence it commenced to sing&mdash;sweetly, like the
low notes, the jug, of the nightingale. My friends
had come, had heard, and were conquered! The
one acknowledged it was really a song and not
a squeak; the other, that the noise was certainly
dulcet; but still he thought it possibly might be
the result of disease, and not natural to the little
animal. We suggested that this wonderful natural
curiosity (as we deemed it) should be sent to
an eminent naturalist who resided near. Great,
therefore, was my astonishment and pleasure when
it was presented to me, who could only treat it
like a schoolboy would his white mouse&mdash;as a
pet. And truly it became a great pet to both
my wife and myself.</p>

<p>'In form, the singing mouse did not differ from
his humbler brethren; but in colour he was of
a darkish brown, and had very bright eyes. It
soon became used to the presence of my wife,
and sang constantly while revolving the wheel
of his cage. The notes proceeded from the throat.
He became exceedingly gentle, and was pleased
at being caressed.</p>

<p>'I deemed him so rare a curiosity that I ventured
to offer to exhibit him to the distinguished naturalist
referred to above, and in my letter described
the little creature and its peculiarities, as I have
done here. The naturalist most courteously
replied: "The case of the singing mouse is very
extraordinary, but the fact is now well established....
The best account which has ever been published
is by an American naturalist, and I have given
an abstract of his account in my <i>Descent of Man</i>.</p>

<p>"The American referred to is the Rev. S. Lockwood,
author of <i>The American Naturalist</i>, and he
gives an account of his observations of the <i>Hesperomys
cognatus</i>, an American species, belonging to a
genus distinct from that of the English mouse. This
little animal gave two chief songs. Mr Lockwood
gives both songs in musical notation; and adds,
that though this mouse 'had no ear for time,' yet
she would keep to the key of B (two flats) and
strictly in the major key.... Her soft clear
voice falls an octave with all the precision possible;
then at the wind up it rises again into a very
quick trill in C sharp and D." I have made this
quotation, as it far better describes the peculiar
qualifications of a singing mouse, than my inexperienced
observations could announce.</p>

<p>'My mouse remained in contented confinement
upwards of a year, feeding upon a little sopped
bread and canary-seed; and great was the grief of
my wife (who was his keeper) and myself when
he was found dead in his little nest. During the
previous evening he had been heard singing with
more than usual ardour.'</p>

<p>We shall probably return to this interesting
subject.</p>

<h2><a name="USING_UP_WASTE_SUBSTANCES" id="USING_UP_WASTE_SUBSTANCES">USING UP WASTE SUBSTANCES.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> subject denoted by the above title, more
than once treated in the <i>Journal</i>, is adverted to
by an obliging Lancashire correspondent who,
surrounded by one of the busiest and most ingenious
clusters of townsmen in England, has had
his attention drawn to various substances waiting
(as it were), for application to useful purposes.
His suggestions are not wholly new, having to
some extent been already anticipated; but they
are sufficiently valuable to call for notice here.</p>

<p>One relates to the waste that presents itself in
the processes of manufacturing cotton. A residue
known technically as <i>willowings</i>, that falls into
a receptacle during the preparatory beating and
disentangling of raw cotton-wool, consists of a
dusty heap of seed-husks and short broken fibres.
It is used by farmers to absorb the liquid manure
of their cowsheds and middens or dung-heaps.
Although some of the cottony fibre may be
separated through a sieve, so much adheres to
the seed-husk as to render it unsuitable for paper-making,
for which it has often been tried. The
suggestion now made is, that though unfitted for
paper, this refuse may possibly be found useful
in the manufacture of <i>millboard</i>. Large quantities
of this tough and durable product are employed for
bookbinding, for making the discs of railway wheels,
&amp;c.; and as colour is not a matter of moment,
the idea is that the mingled residue of cottony
fibre and seed-husk might be rendered available.
It is known that millboard made from wood-pulp
is imported to a considerable extent from abroad;
and we are told that 'a large portion of the
private income of the great German Chancellor
Prince Bismarck is derived from the manufacture
of wood-millboard on his Varzin estate.' Many
hundred tons of willowings could be obtained in
Lancashire at a very cheap rate, even as low as
two shillings per hundredweight.</p>

<p>Another suggestion bears relation to the utilisation
of refuse from the manufacture of prussiate
of potash, a most valuable product in the hands
of the manufacturing chemist. The prussiate is
obtained in large ratio from woollen rags, after the
separation of all the pieces that can be worked up
into shoddy for cheap cloth. The refuse is calcined
in cast-iron retorts, lixiviated with water,
and drained off for subsequent treatment: leaving
behind it a thick black sediment of impure animal
charcoal. The suggestion relates to the application
of this residue to the manufacture of blacking&mdash;a
humble but valuable agent for those who appreciate
tidiness in the appearance of boots and shoes
and economy in the preservation of leather. If
useful for this purpose, it might be found advantageous
and economical as an ingredient in printers'
ink. Whether this carbon residue is at present
applied to any other useful purpose, we are not
fully informed.</p>

<p>A third suggestion relates to the preparation of
animal size for the carpet-manufacture and for
that of many kinds of woollen and worsted goods.
This size is made from the clippings and scrapings
of skins and hides, from rejected scraps of parchment
and vellum, and from the worn-out buffalo
skin pickers and skips largely used in textile
manufactures; also from the pith of cattle-horns,
which contain a large amount of valuable gelatine.
The suggestion is, to utilise the refuse left after
making this size. One large carpet factory in
Yorkshire rejects as utterly useless a ton or more
of this refuse every week. The horn-pith contains
as one of its components phosphate of lime, and is
on that account recommended to the notice of the
manufacturers of chemical manures on a large
scale.</p>

<p>One more suggestion comes from our ingenious
correspondent. Old corks are applicable to a
greater number of purposes than we are generally
in the habit of supposing. That many of them
are ground up to make cork-stuffing for cushions,
padding, &amp;c. is well known; but there are other
uses for them as corks or half corks, besides
making floating buoys and life-preservers. A
taverner in a Lancashire town covered the floor of
his lobby and bar with very open rope-matting,
and filled up the openings with old corks cut
down to the level of the surface of the mats. This
combination is found to be almost indestructible
under the feet; while it gives a good grip or foothold.
As the making of rope-mats is one of the
trades carried on in reformatories and some other
large establishments, it is suggested that the
managers should take into consideration the feasibility
of adding old corks to their store of manufacturing
materials.</p>

<p>As this <i>Journal</i> finds its way into every corner
of the busy hives of industry, it may possibly be
that some of our readers are already acquainted
with such applications of waste refuse to useful
purposes as those which our esteemed correspondent
suggests. But this is a point of minor importance.
The primary question is, not whether
an idea is absolutely new, but whether it is
practicably susceptible of useful application. The
history of manufactures teaches us that apparently
humble trifles like these have proved to be worth
millions sterling to the country.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
